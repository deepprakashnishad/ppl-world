		"MPARA1": "Goodact is unique and innovative invention, popularly known as 'Community-Sharing Crowd-Funding' which has started giving a whole new dimension to the model of traditional crowd-funding. We focus, not just on the cause, but also on how to make it easy for the people to fund that cause, in the simplest and smoothest ways possible. It's just like reverse engineering, where we reproduce a quick path towards the plan implementation and finally accomplishment of the goal that you have in sight.",
		"MPARA2": "Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds through the collective effort of friends, family, fans, customers and individual donors. This approach taps into the collective efforts of a large pool of individuals-primarily online via social media and crowdfunding platforms-and leverages their networks for greater reach and exposure.",
		"MPARA3": "You can donate for causes ( want to run a marathon to raise money for a cause you believe in ) , charities ( fund a NGO /charitable institution/non - profit) , events ( fund a music event , art show , marathon, concert ) & recoveries ( help people impacted by a flood, earthquake, cyclone etc)..",

		"VPARA1": "Our vision is of establishing Varnashrama System in long run. So that people can get engaged in work as per their nature and be satisfied and happy in life. We desire to establish Ram Rajya keeping Lord Rama in center in which each and every individual is happy and satisfied in his life. We do not want even one individual to feel left out in the society. We want people to lead a happy life as per vedic scriptures and after leaving this body they go Back Home Back to Godhead.",
		"VPARA2": "We want each and every individual be engaged as per his nature and skill. We want each child to be educated in his field of interest and well versed with Dharma, so that when he/she grows they stand on their own legs and are happy, satisfied and have strong character which will make our nation strong. We want that not even one sleeps hungry in our country.",

		"FP3": "It provides the opportunity of pre-selling. Launching a crowdfunding campaign gives an entrepreneur the ability to pre-sell a product or concept that they haven't yet taken to market. This is a good way to gauge user reaction and analyze the market in order to decide whether to pursue or pivot on a given concept."
